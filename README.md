# SkyRat
Remote Access Trojan I wrote, but didn't finish. Although, you could use this as is without many issues.
SkyRat is written in C and uses sockets for client/server connection. 
I do plan on updating Skyrat, but have multiple projects at the moment.
Also, I am writing a tutorial on winsock2 for people who would like to create something similar.

FEATURES:

-ability to have multiple connections

-open shell on connected clients (e.g., run commands)

-take a screenshot of a client's desktop

-run shellcode on a client
